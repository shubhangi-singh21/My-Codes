//Given a number n, find length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.
//Logic: {The idea is based on the concept that if we AND a bit sequence with a shifted version of itself, weâ€™re effectively removing the trailing 1 from every sequence of consecutive 1s.
//So the operation x = (x & (x << 1)) reduces length of every sequence of 1s by one in binary representation of x. If we keep doing this operation in a loop, we end up with x = 0. 
//The number of iterations required to reach 0 is actually length of the longest consecutive sequence of 1s.}
